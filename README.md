# Benin Bronzes

The Benin Bronzes website informs vistors about the origins, historic encounters and cultural relevance of the famous Benin Bronzes artefacts.

By combining historic events with contemporary issues relating to these artefacts it is desired that vistors to the website will gain more insights about the Benin Bronzes, and as such awake their support for those advocating for the return of these artefacts back to their place of origin Benin City.

## User Experience (UX)
## Design
### Colour Scheme
The body of the website pages is characterized by a light terracotta coloured background which is used to present the basic face of the website. This colour was intentionally chosen with the aim to blend the background with the traditional colour of the Benin Bronzes artefacts as so capture the atmosphere of Benin City, the origin of where the objects were created. As contrast dark shades of black and brown are used for the headings and text which gives the siteâ€™s visitor a calming feel.

The colour choice was aided using the [webfx color-picker](https://www.webfx.com/web-design/color-picker/ ) tool

### Typography

- Roboto for the prominent h1 and h2 headings.
