# Benin Bronzes

The Benin Bronzes website informs visitors about the origins, historic encounters and cultural relevance of the famous Benin Bronzes artefacts.

By combining historic events with contemporary issues relating to these artefacts it is desired that visitors to the website will gain more insights about the Benin Bronzes and as such awaken their support for those advocating for the return of these artefacts back to their place of origin Benin City.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The body of the website pages is characterized by a light terracotta-coloured background which is used to present the basic face of the website. This colour was purposely chosen with the aim of blending the background colour with the traditional colour of the Benin Bronzes artefacts in order to capture the atmosphere of Benin City, the origin of where the objects were created. To achieve a contrasting display, dark shades of black and brown are used for the headings and for the text which gives the site’s visitor a calming feel.

The colour choice was aided using the [webfx color-picker](https://www.webfx.com/web-design/color-picker/ ) tool

### Typography
Google Fonts was used to select the following free fonts:
- Roboto for the prominent h1 and h2 headings.
- Raleway for the body text content on the website.

Both fonts are san-serif and they complement each other.
### Imagery

### Wireframes
Wireframes of the home page were created for mobile and desktop devices.

### Features
The Benin Bronzes website has four pages, namely the home page, timeline page, gallery page and sign up page. Each of these pages are linked to one another and they can be accessed using the navigation menu in the navigation bar.
- Navigation Bar
    - The navigation bar is responsive and is a feature on all the pages of the website. The navigation bar contains the logo to the left and to the right a navigation menu with links to the home page, the timeline page, gallery page and the sign up page.
    - The navigation bar allows the site user to navigate from one page to another without the need to return back to the previous page. This provides for a better user experience.

    - Showcase section
        - The showcase introduces the main object of focus of the site, namely the Benin Bronzes to the user, explains what the artefacts are, and explains their importance to its original creators and why they are also important today.
        -  This showcase section content benefits the users of the site because with this information they are quickly captured in the story being told and get the motivation to continue to use the site.
        - As part of the section is an embedded video clip with entertaining background information of the artefacts and about the issues involved. The video is a lighter way for a site visitor to quickly grasp the essence of sites main message.

- In the footer I added aria-labels to icons used as links to social media to enable screen readers understand their purpose.
