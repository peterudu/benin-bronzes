# Benin Bronzes

The Benin Bronzes website informs vistors about the origins, historic encounters and cultural relevance of the famous Benin Bronzes artefacts.

By combining historic events with contemporary issues relating to these artefacts it is desired that vistors to the website will gain more insights about the Benin Bronzes, and as such awake their support for those advocating for the return of these artefacts back to their place of origin Benin City.
