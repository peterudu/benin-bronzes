            <h3>What are the Benin Bronzes?</h3>
            <p>The Benin Bronzes are a group of several thousand metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal
                palace of the Kingdom of Benin, in what is now Edo State, Nigeria. Collectively, the objects form the
                best examples of Benin art and were created from the thirteenth century by artists of the Edo people.
                The plaques, which in the Edo language are called Ama, depict scenes or represent themes in the history
                of the Kingdom. Apart from the plaques, other sculptures in brass or bronze include portrait heads,
                jewelry, and smaller pieces.

            <h3>Why are the Benin Bronzes so important?</h3>
            <p>Bronze and ivory objects had a variety of functions in the ritual and courtly life of the Kingdom of Benin. 
                They were used principally to decorate the royal palace, as a courtly art, their principal objective was 
                to glorify the Oba, the divine king, as well as honour the Iyoba of Benin (the queen mother).
            </p>
            <p>The Benin Bronzes offer historians and archaeologists the possibility to better understand the people and 
                culture of the old Benin empire. They also tell historians about Benin's relationships with the Europeans 
                and its neighbouring African states.

            <h3>Contemporary Issues</h3>
            <p>For over a century the Benin Bronzes have been a source of controversy and dispute particularly among European 
                and American museums, Nigerians and the general public. Recently calls for their restitution have thrust 
                European and Nigerian museums together to contend with their shared legacy. As a result this has led to a 
                current debate about who really owns the Benin Bronzes and what should happen to them?</p>
            <p>Today there are more than 5,000 of the Benin Bronzes artefacts being displayed and possessed by European museums 
                and by private collectors. But how did these African works of art end up in these museums? In 1897 Benin City,
                capital of the Benin kingdom was raided by British colonial troops, caputured the king, looted the artefacts from the
                king's palace, and brought them to Britain where they were donated to the London museum and others sold to various 
                art collectors worldwide.

            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>In 2021, the German, Dutch and Belgian governments agreed to identify objects in their museums that were wrongfully
                acquired during the colonial era and start the process of returning them. 16 U.S. museums also annouced that they 
                were in the process of repatriating their Benin Bronzes, including the Smithsonian Institution and the Metropolitan
                Museum of Art in New York. And to further emphasize its intentions, in July 2022 the German government then signed an 
                accord with Nigeria, and returned some Benin Bronzes artefacts
