                    <h3>1180 - Ermergence of the powerful Benin kingdom in 1180  <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-crown"></i></h3>
                    <p>
                       The Benin Kingdom was one of the oldest and most developed states along the coast of West 
                       Africa.It grew out of the older Edo Kingdom of Igodomigodo (which was ruled by Ogisos) 
                       around the 11th century AD and lasted until it was annexed by British troops in 1897. 
                       The first Oba or king of Benin was Eweka (1180-1246). He was the son of the prince from Ife. 
                       The kingdom reached its greatest power and size under Oba Ewuare the Great (1440-1473). He
                       expanded the kingdom and improved the capital and built massive walls around the city, 
                       present-day Benin City. King Ewuare is generally credited for introducing the use of ivory 
                       and wood carving in the empire and encouraging creation of Bronze heads for shrines to deceased 
                       Obas. Another significant Benin king was Oba Esigie (1504-1547) known for having traded with 
                       the Portuguese.

                    <h3>1707 to 1896 - Age of the artefacts (Benin Bronzes)  <i class="fa-regular fa-life-ring"></i></h3>
                    <p>
                        In the late 17th century, the Benin kingdom temporarily declined after a major civil war. However by early 18th century there 
                        was a revival with Oba Ewuakpe who was able to restore the fortunes of the kingdom. His son, Oba Akenzua also expanded trade with Europeans.
                        However historically most important in this  period was the development of an advanced artistic culture, especially in its famous artifacts of 
                        bronze, iron and ivory. These include bronze wall plaques and life-sized bronze heads depicting the Obas and Iyobas (queen mother) of Benin. 
                        These plaques also included other human and animal figures as well as items like ceremonial belts. Ivory was also used, as seen in the carving of 
                        ivory into ornate boxes, combs and armlets. The most well-known artifact is based on Queen Idia, now famously known as the Benin ivory mask. 
                        Ivory masks were meant to be worn around the waist of kings.

                    <h3>1897 - The Benin Raid of 1897   <i class="fa-solid fa-people-robbery"></i></h3>
                    <p>In February 1897, about 1,200 British soldiers raided the Kingdom of Benin in what is now southwestern Nigeria, burning the Edo peoples capital, killing civilians, and exiling the king (Oba Ovonramwen). The British soldiers burned the royal palace and looted and the oba’s royal treasures. These confiscated royal items (known today as the Benin Bronzes) were then given to some individual officers and the majority were then auctioned in London to museums and private collectors. </p>

                    <p>Following the Benin raid and looting of over 5000 pieces of the Benin Bronzes, about 200 pieces were taken to the British Museum in London, while the rest were taken to other European museums. A large number are held by the British Museum with other notable collections in Germany and the United States. Over the years before and after the world wars a large number of the artefacts exchange owners and were sold to private collectors. It became a matter of prestige for European museums and art collectors to own a Benin Bronze artefact.</p>

                    <h3>1950 to 2010 - Attempts to bring back the Benin Bronzes  <i class="fa-regular fa-handshake"></i></h3>
                    <p>During the 20th century the people of present day Benin City as well as the Nigerian government made efforts to bring the Benin Bronzes back to its origin. For instance between 1950 to 1972 the Nigerian government bought back 30 artefacts from The British Museum. Particularly after gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria sought the return of more of these items on several occasions however the British museum was less cooperative due mainly to the rise in valuation of the artefacts by Sotheby’s and Christies. For instance in 2015, a Benin Bronze head was sold to a private collector for a record fee of £10 million. In addition the Benin Bronzes has been a major object for vistors of the museums who fear to loose their major source of income.</p>

                    <h3>2010 to present – A new approach and a bright future  <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-dove"></i></h3>
                    <p>Since the early 2010s there has also been extensive debate over the location of the bronzes being distant from their place of origin. Often, their return has been considered emblematic of the repatriation of the African continent. The Benin Bronze artefacts have become a test case in the international debate over restitution which has helped change attitudes towards repatriation. As a result many European and American museums have either recently returned some of the artefacts or made an agreement to do so. For instance in 20 Germany reached an agreement with the Nigerian government and returned some of the Benin Bronzes from the Berlin museum to Nigerian officials</p>
